## Confidence Verification Checklist

Before any spec is considered "95%+ confident":

- [ ] Minimum 2 Tier 1 or Tier 2 sources corroborate
- [ ] If sources conflict, conflict is investigated and documented
- [ ] Critical specs (power limits, failure points) have real-world data supporting
- [ ] Any claims about "what's possible" are backed by documented builds
- [ ] Cost estimates are from multiple sources
- [ ] Failure modes are documented with evidence, not speculation

**Review Gate:** Owner reviews all research, verifies sources, adds expertise, confirms confidence level before any content is created.
