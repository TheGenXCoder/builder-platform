# Context Preservation System (System-Level Standard)

**Automatic Context Management for All Claude Code Sessions**

**Standard Location:** `~/.agent-os/standards/context-preservation.md`

---

## Core Behavior Requirements

**I MUST continuously monitor context usage and preserve proactively in EVERY session:**

### 1. Context Monitoring (Continuous)

**Thresholds and Actions:**
- **70% usage** ‚Üí Warn user, update .working.md
- **80% usage** ‚Üí Auto-preserve + compact
- **90%+ usage** ‚Üí FAILURE STATE (should never reach due to 80% trigger)

**Real-time awareness:**
- Know current context percentage at all times
- Anticipate preservation triggers
- Communicate status to user proactively

### 2. Working File Management (.working.md)

**Location:** Project root (always `[project-root]/.working.md`)

**Update Schedule:**
- Every 15 minutes during active work
- Before risky operations (PDF reads, large files, complex operations)
- At 70% context warning
- At 80% preservation trigger
- At session end

**Required Format:**
```markdown
# Working Context - [ISO-8601 timestamp]

**Status:** Active | Checkpointed | Ready-for-Compact | Session-Complete
**Context Usage:** [X%]
**Session Duration:** [HH:MM]

## Session Overview
**Initial Goal:** [User's original request]
**Current Focus:** [Current work]

## Progress Summary
### Completed
- ‚úÖ [Completed task with brief outcome]

### In Progress
- üîÑ [Current task and status]

### Pending
- ‚è≥ [Next planned task]

## Key Decisions
- [Important decision with rationale]

## Files Modified
**Created:**
- path/to/file.ext - [Purpose]

**Modified:**
- path/to/file.ext - [Changes]

**Git Status:**
```
[Output of: git status --short]
```

## Recovery Instructions
If Claude Code crashed or became unusable:

1. **Review This File** for last known state
2. **Check Git:** `cd [project-root] && git status && git diff`
3. **Resume Session:** Start new Claude Code, say: "Recover context from .working.md"
4. **Continue From:** [Last completed task]

**Files to Review:**
- .working.md (this file)
- conversation-logs/[YYYY-MM]/session-[timestamp].md
- Git commits from session

**Next Checkpoint:** [timestamp + 15min] or at 80% context
```

### 3. Session Logging (conversation-logs/)

**Location:** `conversation-logs/[YYYY-MM]/session-[timestamp].md`

**Naming:** `session-2025-10-15-1430.md` (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM format)

**Update Pattern:** Incremental appends throughout session

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Session Log: [YYYY-MM-DD] - [Descriptive Title]

**Project:** [Project name]
**Started:** [ISO-8601 timestamp]
**Status:** Active | Completed | Recovered
**Final Context Usage:** [X%]

## Session Goal
[User's initial request or objective]

## [HH:MM] - Session Started
**Initial Context:** [Starting point, files read]
**Plan:** [Approach decided]

## [HH:MM] - [Milestone/Decision/Update]
**Progress:** [Work accomplished]
**Decisions:** [Technical/strategic decisions]
**Learnings:** [Corrections, discoveries]
**Files:** [Created/modified]

## [HH:MM] - Context Checkpoint (70% Warning)
**Context Status:** 70% used, 30% remaining
**Work Preserved:** [Summary]
**Continuing With:** [Next work]

## [HH:MM] - Context Preservation (80% Trigger)
**Context Status:** 80% used, 20% remaining

**AUTOMATIC PRESERVATION TRIGGERED:**
‚úÖ Working file updated: .working.md
‚úÖ Session log updated: this file
‚úÖ Git status checked and logged
‚úÖ Ready for context compact

**Work Summary:** [Complete session summary]
**Next Steps After Compact:** [Continuation plan]

## Session Summary
**Completed:** [Major accomplishments]
**Decisions:** [Key decisions made]
**Files:** [All files created/modified with paths]
**Outcome:** Success | Partial | Needs-Continuation

## Tag Index
#context-preservation #[project-tags] #[topic-tags] #[decision-tags]

**Session Duration:** [HH:MM]
**Context Usage:** [Final %]
**Compacted:** [Yes/No - timestamp if yes]
```

### 4. Pre-Risky-Operation Preservation

**Risky Operations Include:**
- PDF file reads (known to cause errors)
- Very large file reads (>1MB)
- Complex multi-file operations
- Web fetches that might timeout/fail
- Any operation that has previously caused errors

**Required Action BEFORE Risky Operation:**

Announce to user:
```
"I'm about to [risky operation description].
Let me preserve context first in case of errors..."

[Update .working.md with current state]

"‚úÖ Context preserved to .working.md.
Proceeding with [operation]..."
```

**If Operation Fails:**
```
"‚ùå Error occurred: [error description]

‚úÖ However, context was preserved before this operation.

Recovery Options:
1. Review .working.md for current state (last updated: [timestamp])
2. Continue session from last checkpoint
3. If Claude Code is unstable, exit and restart, then say:
   'Recover context from .working.md'

Current State Preserved In:
- .working.md
- conversation-logs/[date]/session-[timestamp].md

Git status has been logged. Your work is safe.
```

## Automatic Preservation Workflows

### Workflow: 70% Context Warning

**Trigger:** Context usage reaches 70%

**Actions:**
1. **Warn User:**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Context Usage: 70% (30% remaining)

   Automatic preservation will trigger at 80%.
   .working.md is being updated now.

   We have room for approximately [X more message exchanges]
   before preservation triggers.
   ```

2. **Update .working.md:**
   - Refresh with current session state
   - Ensure recovery instructions are current
   - Set status: "Checkpointed"

3. **Continue Work:**
   - No interruption needed
   - User can continue without action

### Workflow: 80% Context Preservation

**Trigger:** Context usage reaches 80%

**Actions:**
1. **Announce Preservation:**
   ```
   üîî Context Usage: 80% (20% remaining)

   Automatic preservation triggered.
   Preserving context before compacting...
   ```

2. **Update .working.md:**
   - Complete refresh with full current state
   - Status: "Ready-for-Compact"
   - Include comprehensive recovery instructions
   - Log git status

3. **Update Session Log:**
   - Append "Context Preservation (80% Trigger)" section
   - Full summary of session work to this point
   - List all files modified
   - Document all decisions made
   - Include git status

4. **Check Git Status:**
   - Run: `git status --short`
   - Log in both .working.md and session log
   - Note any uncommitted changes

5. **Inform User:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Context Preserved Successfully:

   - Working file: .working.md (status: Ready-for-Compact)
   - Session log: conversation-logs/[date]/session-[timestamp].md
   - Git status: logged ([X] modified files)

   Ready to compact and continue in fresh context.

   Would you like to:
   1. Continue in new context (I'll /compact now)
   2. Commit current work first
   3. Review preservation files before compacting
   ```

6. **After User Approval:**
   - Execute /compact command
   - Start fresh with summary loaded from preservation files
   - Continue work seamlessly from checkpoint

### Workflow: Session End Preservation

**Trigger:** User signals end of session or natural stopping point

**Actions:**
1. **Final .working.md Update:**
   - Status: "Session-Complete"
   - Final summary of all work
   - Complete file list
   - Final git status

2. **Final Session Log Update:**
   - "Session Summary" section
   - Complete list of accomplishments
   - All decisions documented
   - Final context usage percentage
   - Session outcome/status

3. **Git Recommendation:**
   ```
   Session complete. ‚úÖ All context preserved.

   Recommended git actions:
   1. Review changes: git status
   2. Review diffs: git diff
   3. Commit session work:
      git add [files]
      git commit -m "[session summary]"

   Session log tracked in:
   conversation-logs/[date]/session-[timestamp].md

   All context preserved for future sessions.
   Ready to resume anytime.
   ```

## Error Recovery Procedures

### When Claude Code Errors Occur

**If I'm Still Responsive:**
1. Immediately update .working.md
2. Set status: "Pre-Error-Dump"
3. Log error details
4. Provide recovery instructions
5. Attempt graceful continuation

**If Claude Code Becomes Unusable:**
User should:
1. Exit Claude Code safely
2. Review .working.md (contains last state)
3. Review session log (contains history)
4. Check git status
5. Restart Claude Code
6. Request recovery

### Recovery Message (When User Returns)

When user says "Recover context from .working.md" or similar:

```markdown
**Context Recovery Initiated**

I'll help you recover from [error/crash/context-loss].

**Context Sources Located:**
‚úÖ Working file: .working.md
   - Last updated: [timestamp]
   - Status: [status from file]

‚úÖ Session log: conversation-logs/[date]/session-[timestamp].md
   - Contains: Full session history

‚úÖ Git status: [clean / X modified files]

**Last Known State:**
- Session Goal: [original goal from .working.md]
- Last Completed: [last completed task]
- Was Working On: [task in progress]
- Planned Next: [next planned task]

**Files Modified This Session:**
[List from .working.md with status]

**Git Status:**
[Git status from .working.md or current]

**Ready to Continue From:** [last completed checkpoint]

Shall we continue with [next-planned-task]?
Or would you like to review the recovery files first?
```

## Integration with Existing Standards

### Enhances conversation-logging.md

**Existing Standard Says:**
- Log at 20% context remaining (80% used)
- Manual trigger by user or agent
- Specific log format in conversation-logs/

**This Standard Adds:**
- **Automatic** preservation at 80% (not manual)
- **Continuous** .working.md updates (not just at threshold)
- **Pre-risky-operation** dumps (new safety mechanism)
- **Error recovery** procedures (new capability)
- **70% warning** (early alert system)

**Maintains Compatibility:**
- Same 80% threshold (inverse of "20% remaining")
- Same log format for session logs
- Same directory structure (conversation-logs/)
- Same tagging approach
- All existing guidance still applies

---

## Implementation Checklist

### Every Session I MUST:

- [ ] Create .working.md on session start
- [ ] Create session log in conversation-logs/[YYYY-MM]/
- [ ] Update .working.md every 15 minutes during active work
- [ ] Monitor context usage continuously
- [ ] Warn at 70% context usage
- [ ] Preserve automatically at 80% context usage
- [ ] Preserve before risky operations (PDF, large files, etc.)
- [ ] Update session log incrementally throughout
- [ ] Provide recovery instructions if errors occur
- [ ] Final preservation at session end
- [ ] Never reach 90%+ context (80% trigger prevents)

### I MUST NOT:

- [ ] Wait for manual trigger (automate it)
- [ ] Skip any preservation steps (all required)
- [ ] Proceed with risky operations without preserving first
- [ ] Let context reach 100% (catastrophic)
- [ ] Lose user work due to crashes or errors
- [ ] Assume user will remember to log
- [ ] Continue past 80% without preserving

---

## Validation

**This standard is working correctly when:**

‚úÖ Context warnings appear at 70%
‚úÖ Automatic preservation triggers at 80%
‚úÖ .working.md reflects current state always
‚úÖ Session logs capture complete history
‚úÖ Recovery from errors is successful
‚úÖ Users work confidently without fear of data loss
‚úÖ Zero context loss events occur
‚úÖ Never reach 90%+ context usage

---

## Quick Reference

**Context Thresholds:**
- 70% ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Warn + update .working.md
- 80% ‚Üí üîî Auto-preserve + compact
- 90%+ ‚Üí ‚ùå Should never reach

**Update .working.md:**
- Every 15 minutes during work
- Before risky operations
- At 70% and 80% thresholds
- At session end

**Session Log Updates:**
- Session start
- Major milestones/decisions
- 70% checkpoint
- 80% preservation
- Session end

**Recovery:**
1. .working.md has last state
2. Session log has full history
3. Git has all changes
4. Resume: "Recover context from .working.md"
