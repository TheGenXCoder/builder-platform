# Context Preservation System Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-15

---

## Phase 1: Standards Foundation (Current Phase)

**Objectives:**
- Define context preservation standards
- Create monitoring and preservation specifications
- Establish working file and session log formats
- Document error recovery procedures

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Product mission and vision defined
- ⏳ Context monitoring standard
- ⏳ Session logging standard
- ⏳ Working file format specification
- ⏳ Error recovery procedures
- ⏳ Integration with existing conversation-logging.md

---

## Phase 2: System-Level Implementation

**Objectives:**
- Install standards in `~/.agent-os/standards/`
- Integrate with `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` global instructions
- Test with Builder Platform project
- Validate automatic behavior

**Deliverables:**
- Context preservation standard in system-level Agent-OS
- CLAUDE.md integration for automatic behavior
- Validation test showing 70%/80% thresholds working
- Error recovery test (simulate PDF error, recover)

---

## Phase 3: Real-World Validation

**Objectives:**
- Use system during Q50 Super Saloon content creation
- Validate preservation during long research sessions
- Test recovery from actual errors
- Refine thresholds and triggers based on usage

**Deliverables:**
- Complete session logs from multi-hour work
- Successful error recovery from real crashes
- Refined thresholds (if 70%/80% needs adjustment)
- User confidence in system reliability

---

## Phase 4: Documentation & Distribution

**Objectives:**
- Create comprehensive usage guide
- Document for other Builder Platform users
- Prepare for potential BuilderMethods contribution
- Enable others to adopt system

**Deliverables:**
- User guide: "Context Preservation System Usage"
- Integration guide: "Adding to Your Agent-OS"
- Recovery guide: "What to Do When Errors Occur"
- Contribution to BuilderMethods (if appropriate)

---

## Long-Term Vision

**Future Enhancements:**
- Graph RAG integration (session logs as knowledge nodes)
- Automatic similarity detection (prevent re-researching)
- Context usage prediction (learn personal patterns)
- Multi-session continuity (seamless cross-session context)

**Platform Integration:**
- Foundation for knowledge compounding (D.R.Y. principle)
- Enables automated fact-checking against preserved knowledge
- Supports model distillation (train on preserved context)
- Critical infrastructure for Graph RAG vision

---

**Current Status:** Phase 1 in progress - Standards foundation being created

**Next Milestone:** Complete Phase 1 specifications and standards
