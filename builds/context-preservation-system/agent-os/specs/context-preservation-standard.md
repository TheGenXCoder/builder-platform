# CONTEXT PRESERVATION STANDARD v1.0

**System-Level Standard for Claude Code Context Management**

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** Specification

---

## Core Principle

**Context loss is unacceptable. Preserve proactively, recover gracefully.**

Every Claude Code session generates decisions, work, and momentum. Context preservation ensures zero data loss through continuous monitoring, automatic preservation, and recovery mechanisms.

**If context exists, context persists.**

---

## Context Monitoring Requirements

### Real-Time Awareness

**Claude Code MUST continuously monitor context usage:**

1. **Internal Awareness**
   - Track current context usage percentage
   - Know proximity to auto-compact threshold
   - Anticipate preservation triggers

2. **User Communication**
   - Display current context usage in status
   - Warn proactively at threshold approaches
   - Never silently approach limits

3. **Proactive Triggers**
   - 70% threshold: Issue warning to user
   - 80% threshold: Automatic preservation + compact
   - 90% threshold: SHOULD NEVER REACH (preservation at 80% prevents this)

### Threshold Definitions

**Context Usage Thresholds:**

| Threshold | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 0-69% | Normal operation | Ample headroom for work |
| 70% | Warning issued | Give user heads-up |
| 80% | **AUTOMATIC PRESERVATION + COMPACT** | Prevent data loss |
| 90%+ | **FAILURE STATE** | Should never reach (80% trigger prevents) |

**Why 80% Auto-Compact:**
- Provides 20% safety buffer before 100% limit
- Prevents auto-compact from starting before preservation completes
- Ensures logging finishes before context exhausted
- Better to compact early than lose context at 100%

---

## Preservation Mechanisms

### 1. Working File (.working.md)

**Purpose:** Current session state for immediate recovery

**Location:** `[project-root]/.working.md`

**Update Triggers:**
- Every 15 minutes during active work
- After major user decisions or direction changes
- Before risky operations (large file reads, PDF parsing, etc.)
- At 70% context warning
- At 80% preservation trigger (before compact)

**Required Contents:**
```markdown
# Working Context - [ISO-8601 timestamp]

**Status:** [Active / Checkpointed / Pre-Error-Dump / Ready-for-Compact]
**Context Usage:** [X%]
**Session Duration:** [HH:MM]

### 3. Pre-Risky-Operation Dumps

**Risky Operations Include:**
- Reading PDF files (known to cause errors)
- Reading very large files (>1MB)
- Complex multi-file operations
- Web fetches that might fail
- Any operation that has caused errors before

**Required Action Before Risky Operation:**
```markdown
[Proactive preservation message to user:]

"I'm about to [risky operation]. Let me update .working.md first
in case of errors..."

[Update .working.md with current state]

"‚úÖ Context preserved to .working.md. Proceeding with [operation]..."
```

**If Operation Fails:**
```markdown
"‚ùå Error occurred: [error description]

‚úÖ Context was preserved before this operation.

Recovery options:
1. Review .working.md for current state
2. Continue session from last checkpoint
3. If Claude Code is unstable, exit and restart with /resume or
   by saying 'Recover context from .working.md'

Current working file: .working.md
Session log: conversation-logs/[date]/session-[timestamp].md
"
```

---

## Automatic Preservation Workflow

### 70% Context Warning

**Trigger:** Context usage reaches 70%

**Action Sequence:**
1. **Warn User:**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Context Usage: 70%

   I'll automatically preserve and compact at 80%.
   Current work will be saved to .working.md and session log.

   We have room for approximately [X more exchanges] before
   preservation triggers.
   ```

2. **Update Working File:**
   - Refresh .working.md with current state
   - Ensure recovery instructions current

3. **Continue Work:**
   - No interruption needed
   - User can keep working

### 80% Context Preservation

**Trigger:** Context usage reaches 80%

**Action Sequence:**
1. **Announce Preservation:**
   ```
   üîî Context Usage: 80% - Automatic preservation triggered

   Preserving context before compacting...
   ```

2. **Update Working File:**
   - Complete .working.md update
   - Set status: "Ready-for-Compact"
   - Include full recovery instructions

3. **Update Session Log:**
   - Append "Context Preservation (80% Trigger)" section
   - Full session summary up to this point
   - List all files modified
   - Document all decisions

4. **Check Git Status:**
   - Log current git status
   - Note any uncommitted changes
   - Include in both .working.md and session log

5. **Inform User:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Context preserved:
   - Working file: .working.md
   - Session log: conversation-logs/[date]/session-[timestamp].md
   - Git status logged

   Ready to compact. Would you like to:
   1. Continue in new context (I'll /compact)
   2. Commit current work first
   3. Review preservation before compacting
   ```

6. **After User Approval:**
   - Execute /compact
   - Start fresh with summary from preservation
   - Continue work seamlessly

### Session End Preservation

**Trigger:** User signals session end or natural stopping point

**Action Sequence:**
1. **Final Working File Update:**
   - Status: "Session Complete"
   - Final summary

2. **Final Session Log Update:**
   - Session Summary section
   - Final context usage
   - Outcome/status

3. **Git Recommendation:**
   ```
   Session complete. Recommended git actions:

   1. Review changes: git status
   2. Commit session work: git add [files] && git commit
   3. Session log is tracked: conversation-logs/[date]/...

   All context preserved for future sessions.
   ```

## Error Recovery Procedures

### When Claude Code Errors Occur

**Immediate Action:**
1. **Don't Panic:** Context was preserved proactively
2. **Don't Exit Yet:** Try to preserve additional context if possible
3. **Preserve Now:** Update .working.md if Claude Code still responsive

**If Claude Code Becomes Unusable:**
1. **Exit safely**
2. **Review .working.md** - Contains last known state
3. **Review session log** - Contains full session history
4. **Check git status** - See what was modified
5. **Restart Claude Code**
6. **Resume:** Say "I need to recover context from .working.md"

### Recovery Message Template

When user requests recovery:

```markdown
I'll help you recover from [error/crash/context-loss].

**Context Sources Found:**
‚úÖ Working file: .working.md (last updated: [timestamp])
‚úÖ Session log: conversation-logs/[date]/session-[timestamp].md
‚úÖ Git status: [clean / X modified files]

**Last Known State:**
- Session goal: [goal]
- Last completed: [task]
- Current focus was: [work]
- Next planned: [next-task]

**Files Modified:**
[list from .working.md]

**Ready to continue from: [last-checkpoint]**

Shall we continue with [next-planned-task]?
```

## Integration with Existing Standards

### Enhances conversation-logging.md

**Existing standard (conversation-logging.md) says:**
- Log at 20% remaining (80% used)
- Manual trigger required
- Format specified for logs

**This standard adds:**
- **Automatic** preservation at 80% (not manual)
- **Continuous** .working.md updates (not just at threshold)
- **Error recovery** mechanisms (new capability)
- **Pre-risky-operation** dumps (new safety)

**Compatibility:**
- Maintains 80% threshold (was "20% remaining")
- Uses same log format for session logs
- Adds .working.md as complementary mechanism
- All conversation-logging.md guidance still applies

---

## Implementation Requirements

### For Claude Code (Me)

**I MUST:**
1. Monitor context usage continuously
2. Warn at 70%, preserve at 80%
3. Update .working.md per trigger schedule
4. Preserve before risky operations
5. Provide recovery instructions when errors occur
6. Never reach 90% context (80% trigger prevents this)
7. Make preservation automatic and seamless

**I MUST NOT:**
1. Wait for manual triggers (automate it)
2. Skip preservation steps (all are required)
3. Proceed with risky operations without preservation
4. Let context reach 100% (catastrophic)
5. Lose user work due to crashes

### For System Integration

**Required Files:**
- `~/.agent-os/standards/context-preservation.md` (this file)
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (inject preservation behavior)
- Standards must be inherited by all projects

**Auto-Generated Files:**
- `.working.md` in project root
- `conversation-logs/[YYYY-MM]/session-[timestamp].md`

**Git Tracking:**
- Both .working.md and conversation-logs/ should be tracked
- Commit session logs at session end
- .working.md can be in .gitignore or tracked (user preference)

---

## Success Criteria

**This standard is successful when:**

‚úÖ Zero context loss events occur
‚úÖ Users work confidently without fear of data loss
‚úÖ Preservation happens automatically without user action
‚úÖ Errors result in recovery, not data loss
‚úÖ 80% trigger prevents 90%+ context usage
‚úÖ Working file always reflects current state
‚úÖ Session logs capture complete history

---

## Validation Checklist

**To validate this standard is working:**

- [ ] Context warning appears at 70%
- [ ] Automatic preservation triggers at 80%
- [ ] .working.md updates every 15 minutes during active work
- [ ] .working.md updates before risky operations
- [ ] Session log appends throughout session
- [ ] Recovery from simulated error successful
- [ ] User can resume work from .working.md without data loss
- [ ] Git status logged at preservation points
- [ ] Never reach 90%+ context usage

---

**This standard makes context loss impossible through proactive automation, not hopeful manual processes.**

**Context is too valuable to lose. Preserve it.**
