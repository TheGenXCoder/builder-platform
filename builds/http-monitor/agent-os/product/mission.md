# Product Mission

## Pitch
HTTP Monitor is a lightweight, high-performance self-hosted monitoring platform that helps developers, DevOps teams, and SREs maintain service reliability by providing real-time uptime tracking, performance insights, and intelligent alerting for HTTP/HTTPS endpoints.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **Small to Medium Development Teams**: Teams managing 5-50 services who need reliable monitoring without enterprise complexity or cost
- **Solo Developers & Indie Hackers**: Individual developers running multiple side projects or client sites who need simple, effective uptime monitoring
- **DevOps Teams**: Operations teams requiring visibility into service health across multiple environments (dev, staging, production)
- **SREs**: Site reliability engineers who need detailed performance metrics and trend analysis to maintain SLAs

### User Personas

**Sarah - Full-Stack Developer** (28-35)
- **Role:** Senior Developer at a 15-person startup
- **Context:** Manages 12 microservices across staging and production environments
- **Pain Points:** Current monitoring tools are either too expensive ($100+/month) or too complex to configure. Needs quick setup and clear alerts when services go down.
- **Goals:** Get notified within 1 minute of any service failure. Understand performance trends to prevent issues. Spend less than 30 minutes on monitoring setup.

**Marcus - DevOps Engineer** (32-40)
- **Role:** DevOps lead at a growing SaaS company
- **Context:** Responsible for infrastructure reliability across 25+ internal and customer-facing APIs
- **Pain Points:** Existing tools lack flexibility for custom health checks. Alert fatigue from poorly configured thresholds. No way to track degradation patterns before outages.
- **Goals:** Configure sophisticated health checks beyond simple HTTP 200 responses. Track response time degradation trends. Integrate alerts with existing Slack/PagerDuty workflow.

**Alex - Indie Developer** (25-45)
- **Role:** Independent developer managing 5 client websites and 3 SaaS products
- **Context:** Limited budget, needs visibility across all projects
- **Pain Points:** Can't justify $50-200/month for enterprise monitoring. Needs something self-hosted and cost-effective. Current solution is manual checking.
- **Goals:** Single dashboard for all monitored endpoints. Email alerts for critical failures. Historical data to show clients uptime reports.

## The Problem

### Monitoring Tools Are Either Too Expensive or Too Limited
Most developers face a painful choice: pay $50-500/month for enterprise monitoring platforms with features they don't need, or use basic ping services that only check if a site responds without providing meaningful performance insights. Small teams and indie developers are priced out of proper monitoring, while larger teams pay for complexity they never use.

**Our Solution:** A lightweight, self-hosted monitoring platform that provides enterprise-grade features without the enterprise price tag or resource overhead. Deploy once on your infrastructure with a single Docker command, monitor unlimited endpoints with concurrent checks, and pay nothing beyond minimal hosting costs ($5-10/month VPS).

### Alert Fatigue From Inflexible Monitoring
Traditional monitors send alerts for every blip, creating noise that causes teams to ignore genuine emergencies. They lack the intelligence to distinguish between transient network issues and real service degradation.

**Our Solution:** Smart alerting with configurable retry policies, degradation detection, and threshold-based notifications. Only get alerted when it truly matters, with context about what changed and when.

### No Visibility Into Performance Trends
Knowing a service is "up" isn't enough. Teams need to spot degrading performance before it becomes an outage, identify patterns that predict failures, and understand normal vs. abnormal behavior for their services.

**Our Solution:** Built-in trending and visualization that tracks response times, status codes, and availability over time. Spot degradation patterns days before they become emergencies.

## Differentiators

### Self-Hosted Without the Complexity
Unlike enterprise monitoring platforms that require dedicated infrastructure teams, we provide one-command Docker Compose deployment with sensible defaults. Unlike basic self-hosted tools that require extensive configuration, we work out of the box.

This results in teams monitoring production services within 15 minutes of starting setup, not 15 hours.

### High-Performance Concurrent Monitoring
Unlike monitoring tools built on heavyweight frameworks, we leverage Go's goroutines to check hundreds of endpoints concurrently with minimal resource usage. Unlike solutions that require multiple servers, we run efficiently on a single $5-10/month VPS.

This results in monitoring 100+ endpoints every minute while using less than 100MB of RAM and minimal CPU.

### Intelligent Alerting, Not Just Notifications
Unlike traditional monitors that send alerts on every failure, we implement retry logic, degradation detection, and configurable thresholds. Unlike expensive platforms that charge per alert channel, we support unlimited notification methods.

This results in 80% fewer false alarms while catching 100% of genuine issues, with teams staying informed through their existing communication tools.

### Performance Insights, Not Just Uptime
Unlike simple ping services that only report "up" or "down", we track response times, status codes, headers, and body content. Unlike complex APM tools that require code instrumentation, we provide insights through HTTP-level monitoring alone.

This results in teams identifying performance degradation 2-3 days before it impacts users, without changing application code.

### Developer-First Experience
Unlike enterprise tools designed for dedicated ops teams, we provide API-first design, configuration as code, and seamless CI/CD integration. Unlike basic tools with web-only interfaces, we support programmatic management of all monitoring configuration.

This results in monitoring configuration living in version control alongside application code, enabling true infrastructure-as-code workflows.

### Lightweight Modern UI
Unlike monitoring dashboards built on heavy JavaScript frameworks requiring build pipelines, we use server-driven hypermedia (HTMX) for real-time updates with zero frontend complexity. Unlike tools with bloated UIs, our dashboard loads instantly and updates live without page refreshes.

This results in a responsive, real-time monitoring dashboard with no JavaScript build step and minimal client-side overhead.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Multi-Endpoint Monitoring:** Monitor unlimited HTTP/HTTPS endpoints from a single installation with customizable check intervals (1 minute to 24 hours)
- **Smart Status Detection:** Beyond simple up/down checks, validate status codes, response times, headers, and body content with configurable success criteria
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** Live view of all monitored endpoints with current status, recent response times, and uptime percentages across multiple time windows
