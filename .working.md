# Working Context - 2025-10-22T17:30:00-07:00

**Status:** Session Complete - Week 1 Spec Ready for Implementation
**Context Usage:** ~46%
**Session Duration:** ~4.5 hours

---

## Session Overview

**Project:** Knowledge Graph System (NEW PROJECT)
**Location:** `projects/knowledge-graph-system/`
**Initial Goal:** Plan and spec knowledge management system to solve context loss
**Current Focus:** Building Week 1 Painkiller - immediate relief from context repetition

---

## Major Session Milestones

### 1. Strategic Decision Made ✅
**User chose Path B:** Infrastructure play (5-10 year transformative build)
- "I just took the red pill"
- Building AI-agnostic infrastructure that makes models commodities
- With faith/family boundaries and sustainable pace

### 2. Product Planning Complete ✅
Created three comprehensive documents in `agent-os/product/`:
- **mission.md** (18KB) - Product vision, differentiators, success metrics
- **roadmap.md** (18KB) - Phased development plan, funding triggers
- **tech-stack.md** (22KB) - Complete technical architecture with rationale

### 3. Reality Check - Immediate Pain ✅
**User:** "The lack of this tool is costing me time and money RIGHT NOW. I can't make it a couple hours without having to repeat myself and that makes my skin crawl."

**Decision:** Build Week 1 Painkiller FIRST, then follow full roadmap

### 4. Week 1 Painkiller Spec Created ✅
Created: `agent-os/specs/v0.1-painkiller.md`
- Ruthlessly scoped to 4 commands: add, search, show, list
- PostgreSQL + Go CLI
- No semantic search, no auto-capture (Week 2)
- Goal: Stop repeating yourself to Claude THIS WEEK

### 5. Architecture Design Complete ✅
**Adapter Pattern:** Core (stable) + Adapters (replaceable)
- Core: PostgreSQL + pgvector, search, graph relationships
- Adapters: Claude MCP (Week 1), Gemini (Week 2), Skills (when needed)
- Framework agnostic: agent-os, GitHub spec-kit, any framework

### 6. Foundational Questions Answered ✅
**Critical design decisions from user:**

1. **Storage:** Block-based (topic + 3-5 followups), not individual messages
2. **Search:** Semantic with relevance ranking (exact + related + context)
3. **Context Injection:** N+1 (direct answer + one hop of relationships/tags)
4. **Auto-Save:** Topic completion or significant events (code gen, summary)
5. **Relationships:** Yes - makes search faster, storage cost trivial
6. **Deployment:** Daemon for dev/alpha, distributed cluster for scale
7. **Interface:** No TUI Week 1, maybe basic web dashboard for metrics
8. **First Use:** THIS CONVERSATION (dogfooding immediately)

**Week 1 Success Criteria (User's Words):**
"I STOP LOSING CONTEXT. I don't have to remind you of the same thing over and over."

**Examples:**
- "Always validate against XSD"
- "Spec is derived from integration guide"
- "This client uses Windows even though I develop on Mac"

**User's Current Projects:**
- This knowledge system (building it WITH itself)
- 3-party API middleware (active pain, needs context NOW)
- Real estate lead gen system (future application)
- Multiple projects simultaneously (aerospace/hyprland workspaces)

**User's Workflow:**
- Ghostty terminal running tmux
- Left pane: Claude Code
- Top right: Neovim
- Bottom right: Terminal
- Multiple workspaces (aerospace on Mac, hyprland on Arch)
- Multiple projects at once (context switching is frequent)

## Critical User Context

**Founder Profile:**
- Age: 50 (second-act founder, prime building years)
- Current: Part-time job hours (needs to maintain income while building)
- Constraint: Building part-time initially, will scale with traction/funding
- Pattern: History of quitting projects - this needs to be THE win
- Boundaries: Faith and family non-negotiable (sustainable pace required)
- Living the pain: Repeating context to Claude makes his "skin crawl"

**Key Decisions:**
- Chose Path B (infrastructure, 5-10 year build)
- But building Week 1 Painkiller FIRST (immediate relief)
- TUI preferred over simple CLI (better UX, fits workflow)
- Must integrate into existing flow (won't use if requires context switching)

---

## Technical Decisions Made

**Week 1 Painkiller Stack:**
- PostgreSQL (full-text search via GIN index)
- Go + Cobra (CLI framework)
- TUI framework: TBD (discussing options - Bubble Tea likely)
- 4 commands: add conversation, search, show, list

**Long-term Architecture:**
- PostgreSQL + pgvector (Phase 1)
- Neo4j (Phase 2)
- Go (services) + Python (ML pipelines)
- Local-first, federation-capable

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate (Today):**
- Design TUI/workflow integration
- Understand user's terminal setup and flow
- Decide on UX approach (tmux split? hotkey? Neovim plugin? MCP?)

**This Week:**
- Build Week 1 Painkiller
- User starts using it daily
- Stop context repetition pain

**Next Week:**
- Add semantic search (pgvector)
- Add auto-capture
- Polish based on real usage

## Recovery Instructions

If session interrupted:

1. **Review this file** for current state
2. **Review project files:**
   - `projects/knowledge-graph-system/README.md`
   - `agent-os/product/mission.md`
   - `agent-os/specs/v0.1-painkiller.md`
3. **Current work:** Designing TUI/workflow integration
4. **User is actively using Claude** - experiencing the pain RIGHT NOW
5. **Goal:** Build something usable THIS WEEK

---

## Important Notes

**User just tested me:**
"When was the last time you preserved context?"

**Good catch.** I need to preserve more frequently during active work.

**Context preservation is the PRODUCT we're building.** I should be the first user of my own standards.

**Session Status:** Complete - Ready to Build Week 1

## Session Accomplishments (4.5 hours)

### Major Milestones
1. ✅ Strategic decision: Infrastructure play (Path B) - "took the red pill"
2. ✅ Product planning complete (mission, roadmap, tech-stack)
3. ✅ Architecture design: Core + Adapter pattern (hedge against AI tool changes)
4. ✅ Foundational questions answered (8 critical design decisions)
5. ✅ Comprehensive Week 1 spec created (ready to implement)

### Files Created
- `agent-os/product/mission.md` (18KB) - Product vision
- `agent-os/product/roadmap.md` (18KB) - Development plan
- `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md` (22KB) - Technical architecture
- `agent-os/specs/week-1-core-system.md` (comprehensive implementation spec)
- `conversation-logs/2025-10/session-2025-10-22-knowledge-graph-genesis.md` (session log)

### Critical Insights
**User's dad teaching moment:** "Dad, what's that?" - patient explanation, never assume
**Week 1 success:** "I STOP LOSING CONTEXT" - no more repeating yourself
**First use case:** Dogfooding (use it to build itself)
**Architecture:** Stable core (expensive, permanent) + cheap adapters (replaceable)

### Tomorrow's Tasks
1. Review Week 1 spec (`agent-os/specs/week-1-core-system.md`)
2. Start implementation (PostgreSQL + Go core)
3. Begin dogfooding immediately
4. Stop losing context for real

**User is committed. Red pill taken. Spec complete. Ready to build.**
