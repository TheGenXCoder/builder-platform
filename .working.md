# Working Context - 2025-10-15T17:04:00-07:00

**Status:** Active
**Context Usage:** ~34%
**Session Duration:** ~01:03

## Session Overview

**Project:** Builder Platform - Context Preservation System
**Initial Goal:** Design and implement system-level context preservation standard for Claude Code
**Current Focus:** Testing and validating the implementation

---

## Progress Summary

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Created context-preservation-system project in builds/
- ‚úÖ Installed Agent-OS in project
- ‚úÖ Created product planning documents (mission.md, roadmap.md, tech-stack.md)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive context-preservation-standard.md specification
- ‚úÖ Created system-level-integration.md specification
- ‚úÖ Created condensed system-level standard for ~/.agent-os/
- ‚úÖ Created CLAUDE.md integration section
- ‚úÖ Installed context-preservation.md to ~/.agent-os/standards/
- ‚úÖ Backed up ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- ‚úÖ Appended context preservation section to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- ‚úÖ Created .working.md and session log (demonstrating system)
- ‚úÖ Created /install-agent-os slash command
- ‚úÖ Added command to Agent-OS profile for distribution
- ‚úÖ Documented complete installation and usage

### In Progress
- üîÑ Final session wrap-up

### Pending
- ‚è≥ Test /install-agent-os in new project
- ‚è≥ Final session wrap-up and git commit

## Key Decisions

1. **Standards-Driven Approach:** Context preservation implemented as Agent-OS standards that guide Claude Code behavior, not external hooks (which don't exist in Claude Code)

2. **System-Level Installation:** Standards installed in ~/.agent-os/ to apply universally to all projects, integrated into ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md for automatic behavior

3. **Two-File Preservation:**
   - .working.md for immediate recovery (current state)
   - conversation-logs/ for complete history

4. **Thresholds:**
   - 70% context ‚Üí warning + .working.md update
   - 80% context ‚Üí auto-preservation + compact
   - Never reach 90%+ (80% trigger prevents)

5. **Pre-Risky-Operation:** Preserve before PDF reads, large files, complex operations

6. **Spec-Driven Development:** Used Builder Platform methodology to build the platform itself (eating own dog food)

## Important Context

**User Requirements:**
- Emphatic preservation of context (zero data loss tolerated)
- Automatic logging and preservation (not manual)
- 80% auto-compact threshold with 20% buffer
- Pre-error context dumps (before risky operations)
- Recovery mechanisms when errors occur
- System-level defaults for all Claude Code sessions

**Technical Approach:**
- I AM the hook system (no external hooks exist in Claude Code)
- Standards guide my behavior through ~/.agent-os/ and ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- Proactive monitoring and preservation, not reactive
- .working.md + session logs for dual preservation

**Philosophy:**
- "Context loss is unacceptable"
- "Preserve proactively, recover gracefully"
- "Cost of over-logging: trivial. Cost of under-logging: catastrophic"
- Building reliable platform, not duct-tape and bailing wire

**Methodology Used:**
- Spec-driven development (Builder Platform methodology)
- Created project in builds/
- Product planning (mission, roadmap, tech stack)
- Comprehensive specifications
- System-level implementation
- Testing and validation

## Recovery Instructions

If Claude Code crashed or became unusable:

1. **Review This File** for last known state
2. **Check Git:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/BertSmith/personal/builder-platform
   git status
   git diff
   ```
3. **Resume Session:**
   - Start new Claude Code session
   - Say: "Recover context from .working.md"
4. **Continue From:** Testing and validation phase

**Files to Review:**
- .working.md (this file)
- builds/context-preservation-system/ (project directory)
- ~/.agent-os/standards/context-preservation.md (installed standard)
- ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (updated global instructions)

**Next Steps:**
- Validate installation
- Test preservation behavior
- Create session log
- Document completion

---

**Session Status:** Ready for completion and git commit

**User Feedback:** "wow, that's awesome! I truly believe this will help me significantly. I love spec driven development, I love agentic architectures, and I love automation. There's nothing better IMO to insure consistency and strict adherence to principled development."

**Next Checkpoint:** Session completion - commit to git
