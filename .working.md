# Working Context - 2025-10-27T00:34:00Z

**Status:** Active - PRODUCTION DEPLOYED
**Context Usage:** ~75%
**Session Duration:** 54 minutes

## CRITICAL UPDATE: System Now LIVE in Production

**üöÄ catalyst9.ai is DEPLOYED and OPERATIONAL**
- Full Knowledge Graph System running on dev-mini
- 2,902 knowledge blocks migrated and accessible
- HTTPS with trusted certificates via Cloudflare
- MCP configurations updated for remote access

---

## Session Overview

**Project:** Catalyst9 Knowledge Graph System
**Initial Goal:** Deploy to production with Docker, DNS, and HTTPS
**Current Focus:** Preserving context and committing critical deployment files

---

## Major Deployment Accomplishments

### 1. Production Infrastructure Complete ‚úÖ
- Docker containers running on dev-mini (75.163.222.167)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector (2,902 blocks preserved)
- Redis cache operational
- Go API v0.9.0 responding
- Nginx reverse proxy with HTTPS

### 2. DNS & SSL Configuration ‚úÖ
- catalyst9.ai domain configured via Cloudflare
- Trusted SSL certificates (no more browser warnings!)
- DDoS protection and CDN caching enabled
- Real server IP hidden

### 3. MCP Remote Access ‚úÖ
- Three connection modes configured:
  - knowledge-graph-local (local DB)
  - knowledge-graph-tunnel (SSH tunnel)
  - knowledge-graph-api (via catalyst9.ai API - RECOMMENDED)

### 4. Data Migration Complete ‚úÖ
- All 2,902 blocks from local PostgreSQL
- Successfully imported to production
- Verified via API and direct DB queries

## Files Created/Modified This Session

**Deployment Infrastructure (NEW):**
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage Go build
- `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-stack.yml` - Container orchestration
- `deploy/nginx/` - Complete HTTPS configuration
- `deploy/dns/` - Cloudflare management scripts
- `projects/knowledge-graph-system/cmd/server/` - Go API server
- `projects/knowledge-graph-system/mcp-api-wrapper.py` - Remote MCP access

**Context Preservation:**
- `conversation-logs/2025-10/session-2025-10-26-2340.md` - Full deployment log
- `deploy/dns/.working.md` - Deployment-specific documentation

---

## Git Status - CRITICAL

**4 Commits NOT PUSHED to origin:**
1. Week 1.5 Complete + Documentation Chunker
2. Session resume guide
3. Multi-Tenant Foundation
4. Week 1 Implementation Complete

**Uncommitted Files (deployment work):**
```
?? .github/
?? Dockerfile
?? deploy/
?? docker-compose.yml
?? docker-stack.yml
?? projects/knowledge-graph-system/cmd/server/
?? projects/knowledge-graph-system/mcp-api-wrapper.py
?? projects/neovim-kg-plugin/
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT: Need to commit and push all deployment work**

---

## Production Status

### Live Services
**URL:** https://catalyst9.ai
- `/health` - API health check ‚úÖ
- `/api/v1/search` - Knowledge search
- `/api/v1/chat` - Chat interface
- `/api/v1/knowledge/*` - Knowledge management
- `/api/v1/nvim/*` - Neovim integration

### Docker Containers (dev-mini)
```
nginx-catalyst9       Up 40+ minutes    ports: 80,443
api-catalyst9         Up 50+ minutes    port: 8080 (healthy)
redis-catalyst9       Up 50+ minutes    port: 6379
postgres-catalyst9    Up 50+ minutes    port: 5432
```

### Database
- **Blocks:** 2,902
- **Status:** Operational
- **Backups:** Need to configure

---

## Recovery Instructions

If Claude Code crashed or context lost:

1. **Check Production:**
   ```bash
   curl https://catalyst9.ai/health
   ssh dev-mini 'docker ps'
   ```

2. **Review Context:**
   - This file: `.working.md`
   - Session log: `conversation-logs/2025-10/session-2025-10-26-2340.md`
   - Deployment details: `deploy/dns/.working.md`

3. **Resume Work:**
   - Say: "Recover context from .working.md"
   - Continue with: Committing deployment files

4. **Critical Services:**
   - catalyst9.ai is LIVE
   - All containers running on dev-mini
   - MCP can connect via API

---

## Next Critical Actions

### IMMEDIATE (Before context loss):
1. ‚è≥ Commit all deployment files
2. ‚è≥ Push to origin (4 commits + new)
3. ‚è≥ Verify git sync complete

### Soon:
- Set up PostgreSQL backups
- Configure monitoring/alerts
- Document deployment process
- Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Important Context from Earlier Sessions

**Original Vision (Week 1):**
- Stop losing context (ACHIEVED via deployment!)
- 4 commands: add, search, show, list
- User's pain: "repeating myself makes my skin crawl"

**Progress:**
- Week 1: Core system built ‚úÖ
- Week 1.5: Import system (1,412‚Üí2,902 blocks) ‚úÖ
- Today: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT ‚úÖ

**User Profile:**
- Age 50, second-act founder
- Part-time initially (maintaining income)
- Faith/family boundaries (sustainable pace)
- Multiple simultaneous projects
- Ghostty terminal + tmux workflow

---

## Session Summary

**Duration:** ~54 minutes
**Context Used:** ~75%
**Status:** Need to commit/push before context loss

**Major Win:** System is LIVE at catalyst9.ai with all data preserved!

**Immediate Risk:** Deployment work not yet in git - MUST COMMIT NOW

---

**Next Checkpoint:** After git commit/push (~5 minutes)
