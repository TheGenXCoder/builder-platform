- Video content (15-20min long-form, 60-90sec shorts)
- Speaking presentation (18-20min TED-style)
- Comprehensive Q50 technical research with sources
- Build planning documentation

---

## Phase 3: Domain Expansion (Q1 2025)

**Objectives:**
- Prove domain-agnostic methodology with second domain
- Apply same standards to different subject matter
- Validate cross-domain learning

**Deliverables:**
- Culinary domain subproject (cassoulet study or similar)
- Domain-specific source tier examples for cuisine
- Demonstration of methodology portability
- Cross-domain pattern documentation

---

## Phase 4: Graph RAG Implementation (Q2-Q3 2025)

**Objectives:**
- Implement Neo4j knowledge graph
- Enable D.R.Y. principle (query before researching)
- Demonstrate knowledge compounding

**Deliverables:**
- Neo4j database with conversation logs as nodes
- Query system for existing verified research
- Tag-based relationship mapping
- Initial automation (fact-check against knowledge base)

---

## Phase 5: Model Distillation & Automation (Q4 2025)

**Objectives:**
- Train specialized agents on platform knowledge
- Automate repetitive verification tasks
- Accelerate research through intelligent assistance

**Deliverables:**
- Automotive research agent (trained on verified Q50/automotive specs)
- Quality control agent (trained on platform standards)
- Research acceleration measurable (30hrs → 15hrs → 8hrs)

---

## Long-Term Vision (2026+)

**Platform as Service:**
- Enable other expert builders to use methodology
- Multi-user knowledge graph (privacy-preserved)
- Cross-expert learning and pattern recognition
- 1,000 experts, one platform, compounding knowledge
