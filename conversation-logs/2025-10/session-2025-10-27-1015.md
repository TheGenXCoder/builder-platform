# Session Log: 2025-10-27 - Context Preservation & UTA Resume

**Project:** Catalyst9 Knowledge Graph System
**Started:** 2025-10-27T10:06:00Z
**Status:** Active
**Final Context Usage:** TBD

## Session Goal
Continue from previous session: Test Arch setup, implement dogfooding, resume UTA project work.

## 10:06 - Session Started
**Initial Context:** Recovered from previous session summary
**Plan:**
1. Complete simplified installer for Arch
2. Implement dogfooding (use C9 while building C9)
3. Resume UTA project with proper context

## 10:08 - One-Command Installer Completed
**Progress:** Created install.sh to reduce setup friction
**Decisions:** Single command instead of 7+ manual steps
**Files:** install.sh, ARCH-SETUP.md (reference)
**Commit:** 41ce7cd

## 10:09 - Dogfooding Request
**User:** "DOGFOOD?"
**Response:** Implement multi-project context switching to use C9 while building C9

## 10:10 - Context Switching Implementation Started
**User Requirement:** "needs to be configurable for multiple projects/orgs. I need to be able to quickly switch context."

**Design Decisions:**
- .c9rc files for project-level configuration
- Shell helper functions for quick switching
- Automatic context detection (walks directory tree)
- Environment variable overrides
- Context-aware MCP operations

**Implementation:**
1. Created .c9rc file format
2. Updated catalyst9-mcp.py to load and use context
3. Modified search_knowledge() to use context defaults
4. Modified add_knowledge() to use context defaults
5. Created c9-context.sh with helper functions
6. Created examples and documentation

## 10:14 - Multi-Project Context System Complete
**Files:**
- .c9rc - Catalyst9 project config
- .c9rc.example-uta - UTA example
- scripts/c9-context.sh - Shell helpers
- CONTEXT-SWITCHING.md - Full documentation
- catalyst9-mcp.py - Context detection logic

**Features:**
- Automatic org/visibility/tag defaults per project
- Quick switching: c9-uta, c9-catalyst, c9-personal
- Context hierarchy: env vars > .c9rc > defaults
- Team-shareable via git

**Commit:** a0c3b9d

## 10:15 - Critical Context Preservation Discussion
**User Concern:** "I absolutely believe that having a chat client that I can make deterministic is critical"
**Real Problem Identified:** Context loss due to not following CLAUDE.md standards

**User Statements:**
1. "consistent loss of context IS the problem. NOT FOLLOWING custom instructions, as defined in claude documentation, that's unacceptable."
2. "Do I want you to properly conserve context this session, NO, I want you to do so for EVERY session, period."
3. "Now I can leave my primary computer at home and take my air with me when I travel and KNOW that I can always pick up where I left off."
4. "What do I think is priority right now, UTA. I need to get my other terminal setup to get back on, and finish that project, but everytime I start working on it again, I feel like I spend half the context reminding you of what you should already know."

**Key Insights:**
- Context preservation standards exist but aren't followed
- User spends half of context re-explaining previous work
- Priority: UTA project completion
- Solution: Use C9 itself for context management (portable across machines)
- Git for code, C9 for context

**Action Items:**
1. ✅ Create .working.md (done)
2. ✅ Create session log (this file)
3. ⏳ Load UTA context from C9
4. ⏳ Resume UTA work with full context
5. ⏳ Implement automatic context preservation for ALL future sessions
6. ⏳ Evolve to use C9 as context storage (mid-term)

## 10:16 - Context Preservation Implementation
**Current Action:** Creating .working.md and conversation log
**Next:** Load UTA project context from C9 to enable productive work
**Goal:** Stop making user re-explain, use stored context

## Session Summary
**Completed:**
- One-command installer for cross-platform setup
- Multi-project context switching system
- Dogfooding capability (use C9 while building C9)
- Context preservation system started

**Decisions:**
- Priority: UTA project completion
- Context must be preserved EVERY session
- C9 becomes context management system (portable across machines)
- Standards from CLAUDE.md must be followed always

**Files:**
- All files committed and pushed (working tree clean)

**Outcome:** System ready for dogfooding, context preservation implemented, ready to resume UTA work
