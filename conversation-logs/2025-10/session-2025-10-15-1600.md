# Session Log: 2025-10-15 - Context Preservation System Implementation

**Project:** Builder Platform - Context Preservation System
**Started:** 2025-10-15T16:00:00-07:00
**Status:** Active
**Current Context Usage:** ~35%

---

## Session Goal

Design and implement a system-level context preservation standard for Claude Code that makes context loss impossible through proactive monitoring, automatic preservation, and graceful error recovery.

**User's Pain Point:**
- Claude Code errors (PDF too large, etc.) corrupt context → forced exit
- Exit clears context → significant work lost
- No recovery mechanism → extremely demoralizing
- /resume reloads corrupted context → doesn't help

**Solution Requirements:**
- Pre-read hook equivalent (context dump before errors)
- Auto-compact at 80% context (with 20% buffer)
- Automatic session logging throughout
- Recovery procedures when errors occur
- System-level default behavior for ALL Claude Code sessions

---

## 16:00 - Session Started

**Initial Context:**
User requested proactive context preservation system after experiencing fatal errors that corrupted Claude Code context and forced exit with complete work loss.

**Key User Guidance:**
- "This is extremely demoralizing after getting on a good pace"
- "Show me a plan and then we can walk through the implementation"
- "We are spec driven, period"
- "Start a new project...and let's eat our own dog food"
- "Building reliable platform, not sticking bailing wire and duct-tape on twigs"

**Plan:**
User wants Builder Platform methodology applied to this problem:
1. Plan the product (mission, roadmap, tech stack)
2. Create specifications
3. Implement system-level standards
4. Test and validate

---

## 16:05 - Claude Code Capabilities Research

**Investigated:** Does Claude Code have hook system for pre-tool-call context dumps?

**Findings:**
- No explicit pre-tool-call hook system found
- No built-in error recovery hooks
- Available: settings.json, CLAUDE.md (global instructions), debug mode
- **Reality:** Claude Code doesn't have external hook system like git hooks

**Critical Realization:** "I AM the hook system"

**Approach Decision:**
Rather than external hooks (don't exist), create standards that guide Claude Code's behavior directly. Standards-driven, not script-driven.

**User Response:** "1 - you are Claude Code, I would assume you know the answer"
→ Correct, I should know my own capabilities

---

## 16:10 - Project Structure Created

**Action:** Created context-preservation-system project using Builder Platform structure

**Created:**
- `builds/context-preservation-system/` (project root)
- Installed Agent-OS using official installation script
- Agent-OS 2.0.3 installed successfully:
  - 19 standards
  - 4 Claude Code commands
  - 6 Claude Code agents

**Rationale:** Eating our own dog food - using the platform to build platform infrastructure

---

## 16:15 - Product Planning Phase

**Documents Created:**

### mission.md (7.9KB)
**Content:**
- Product Vision: "Proactive Context Preservation for Claude Code: Zero Data Loss, Total Reliability"
- Core Mission: Transform context management from reactive to proactive
- Product Principles:
  - Proactive Over Reactive
  - Standards Over Scripts (I AM the hook system)
  - Zero Data Loss
  - Seamless Integration
- Success Metrics: Zero context loss events, 100% session logging, auto-compact prevention
- Target Outcome: Users work confidently without fear of context loss

### roadmap.md (2.4KB)
**Phases:**
- Phase 1: Standards Foundation (current)
- Phase 2: System-Level Implementation
- Phase 3: Real-World Validation
- Phase 4: Documentation & Distribution
- Long-Term: Graph RAG integration, context usage prediction

### tech-stack.md (3.5KB)
**Key Decisions:**
- Standards-driven (not external scripts) - works within Claude Code architecture
- System-level (~/.agent-os/) - universal default behavior
- Markdown logs - human-readable, git-friendly, future-proof
- .working.md in project root - obvious recovery location
- No external dependencies - robust and integrated

---

## 16:30 - Comprehensive Specifications Created

### context-preservation-standard.md (14.7KB)
**Detailed specification including:**

**Core Principle:** "Context loss is unacceptable. Preserve proactively, recover gracefully."

**Context Monitoring:**
- 70% threshold: Warning + .working.md update
- 80% threshold: Auto-preserve + compact
- 90%+: FAILURE STATE (should never reach)

**Preservation Mechanisms:**
1. **Working File (.working.md)**
   - Location: Project root
   - Updates: Every 15min, before risky ops, at thresholds
   - Purpose: Current session recovery point

2. **Session Logs (conversation-logs/)**
   - Location: conversation-logs/[YYYY-MM]/session-[timestamp].md
   - Updates: Incremental appends throughout session
   - Purpose: Complete session history

3. **Pre-Risky-Operation Dumps**
   - Before PDF reads (known error source)
   - Before large file operations (>1MB)
   - Before complex multi-file operations

**Automatic Workflows:**
- 70% Warning workflow (warn, update, continue)
- 80% Preservation workflow (preserve, inform, compact)
- Session End workflow (finalize, recommend git commit)
- Error Recovery workflow (dump, instruct, enable resume)

**Integration:** Enhances existing conversation-logging.md standard with automation

### system-level-integration.md (6.1KB)
**Implementation specification:**
- Installation locations (~/.agent-os/, ~/.claude/)
- File contents for system-level deployment
- Installation steps with validation
- Rollback procedures if issues occur
- Success criteria checklist

---

## 16:45 - System-Level Files Created

**Condensed version for ~/.agent-os/standards/**
- All core requirements
- Format specifications
- Automatic workflows
- Integration notes
- References to full detailed spec

### claude-md-integration-section.md (11.5KB)
**Section to append to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md**

## 16:55 - System-Level Installation

**Actions:**

1. **Created System Standards Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.agent-os/standards/
   ```

2. **Installed Context Preservation Standard:**
   ```bash
   cp builds/context-preservation-system/output/context-preservation-standard-system-level.md \
      ~/.agent-os/standards/context-preservation.md
   ```

   Result: 7.3KB file installed to system level

3. **Backed Up CLAUDE.md:**
   ```bash
   cp ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.backup-20251015-170315
   ```

   Backup created: 12KB

4. **Integrated Context Preservation into CLAUDE.md:**
   ```bash
   cat builds/context-preservation-system/output/claude-md-integration-section.md >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
   ```

   Result: Context preservation section appended to global Claude Code instructions

**Installation Complete:** System-level standards now active for ALL Claude Code sessions

   - Current session state
   - Progress summary (completed/in-progress/pending)
   - Key decisions made
   - Files modified
   - Recovery instructions

2. **This Session Log** - Demonstrates incremental session logging
   - Chronological progress through session
   - Decisions and rationale
   - Teaching moments and corrections
   - Complete file list
   - Git status tracking

**Validation Status:**
- [ ] .working.md created ✅
- [ ] Session log created ✅ (this file)
- [ ] Git status checked ✅
- [ ] System-level standard installed ✅
- [ ] CLAUDE.md integration complete ✅
- [ ] Context monitoring active (next session to test)
- [ ] 70% warning (will test when reached)
- [ ] 80% preservation (will test when reached)
- [ ] Error recovery (need to simulate)

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Standards-Driven Architecture**
   - Decision: Use Agent-OS standards to guide behavior, not external hooks
   - Rationale: Claude Code doesn't have external hook system; standards guide agent behavior directly
   - Impact: Robust, integrated, maintainable approach

2. **Two-File Preservation System**
   - Decision: .working.md (current state) + session logs (complete history)
   - Rationale: Quick recovery from .working.md; complete context from session logs
   - Impact: Both immediate and comprehensive recovery mechanisms

3. **80% Auto-Compact Threshold**
   - Decision: Automatically preserve at 80% context usage
   - Rationale: 20% buffer ensures preservation completes before 100% limit
   - Impact: Never lose context to auto-compact

4. **System-Level Installation**
   - Decision: Install to ~/.agent-os/ and ~/.claude/ for universal application
   - Rationale: Should be default behavior for all Claude Code sessions
   - Impact: No per-project configuration; automatic everywhere

5. **Spec-Driven Development**
   - Decision: Use Builder Platform methodology to build this system
   - Rationale: "Eat our own dog food" - prove the platform works
   - Impact: Created robust, well-documented system following our own standards
