**Project:** Q50 Super Saloon / Builder Platform
**Date:** October 3, 2024
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours
**Participants:** Owner (BertSmith), Claude (Assistant)

---

## Executive Summary

Initial planning session for the Builder Platform - an Agent OS approach to automotive content creation and builder knowledge management. Q50 Super Saloon project is v1.0 of a scalable platform for multi-build documentation and community knowledge sharing.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Defined comprehensive research specifications (95%+ confidence standard)
- Established writing style guide and voice
- Created platform architecture for reusable content infrastructure
- Set quality standards and verification protocols
- Planned multi-format content strategy (articles, video, speaking)

---

## Key Decisions

### Platform Architecture
- **Structure:** Build-specific folders nested under reusable platform components
- **Future State:** Graph DB (Neo4j) for knowledge cross-referencing
- **AI Strategy:** Local-first models with classifier/router, cloud fallback only when necessary
- **Knowledge Management:** Conversation logging (2hr/80% context triggers), Graph RAG for semantic search
- **Quality Standard:** 95%+ confidence on all specs driving build decisions

### Q50 Build Philosophy
- **Power Goal:** 600-800hp, emphasis on torque
- **Use Case:** 80/20 street/track split
- **Concept:** "Gentleman's weapon" - understated elegance meets serious capability
- **Approach:** Cost-conscious quality ("KW coilovers, pull-a-part control arms")
- **Mission:** Friday night gala â†’ Saturday morning track terror

### Content Strategy
- **Formats:** Long-form articles (3,500-5,000 words), video (15-20 min), speaking (18-20 min TED-style), social shorts
- **Publication:** Multi-platform (Medium, Reddit, personal blog, guest submissions to Car & Driver aspirationally)
- **Cadence:** Weekly articles + video starting Nov 1, 2024
- **Voice:** Authoritative craftsman (Sean Connery richness + John Paul DeJoria class)
- **Philosophy:** Zero tolerance for inaccuracy, mentorship/elevation focus

### Research Priorities (95%+ Confidence Required)

**Critical Path (Week 1):**
1. VR30DDTT complete technical specifications
2. VR38DETT swap feasibility (is it even possible?)
3. Transmission options (7AT limits, manual swap feasibility, AWD retention)
4. Build decision matrix (VR30 built vs VR38 swap, trans path, turbo upgrade path)

**Supporting Research (Week 2):**
5. Complete VR30 documentation (fueling, cooling, failure modes)
6. Driveline components (driveshafts, U-joints, proven options)
7. Modification ecosystem (vendors, shops, proven builds)

**Context Research (Week 2-3):**
8. Historical lineage (Skyline â†’ G35/G37 â†’ Q50, verify claims)
9. Competitive analysis (RS4/5, M3/5, C43/63, Blackwing, G70, Panamera)
10. "Overlooked platform" narrative development

---

## Critical Research Questions

### Technical (Must Answer Before Build Decisions)
1. **VR30 head lifting issue:** At what boost/power? Root cause? Proven fix? Cost?
2. **VR30 safe power limits:** Stock block with head studs - what's proven reliable?
3. **VR38 swap:** Will it fit between frame rails? Has anyone done it? Why/why not?
4. **Q50 manual transmission:** Does factory manual exist (especially AWD)? Swap options?
5. **Manual + AWD:** Is this even possible? Or manual = RWD only?
6. **7AT power limits:** Stock? With upgrades? What's max reliable power?

### Historical (Must Verify Before Claiming)
1. **V37 = Skyline?** Is Q50 called "Skyline" in Japan? Is lineage real or marketing?
2. **VR30 â†” VR38 relationship:** Any shared GT-R DNA? Engineering connection?
3. **Red Sport 400:** Real performance variant or marketing package? Exact spec differences?
4. **G37 â†’ Q50 evolution:** Platform continuity? Parts compatibility?

## Conversation Highlights

### Opening Vision
Owner described desire to create comprehensive content around automotive builds:
- Well-written, historically accurate articles
- Professional video production
- Public speaking engagements
- Focus on Q50 as "ultimate super saloon" - understated class with serious track capability

### Builder Platform Concept
Evolved from "content creation" to "Agent OS for builders":
- Reusable infrastructure across multiple builds
- Persistent knowledge base
- Specialized AI agents for research, writing, fact-checking
- Platform that scales beyond Q50 to future projects (C63 AMG mentioned)
- Potential consulting tool for other builders

### Quality Standards Discussion
Owner established zero-tolerance policy:
- 95%+ confidence on all specifications
- Personal reputation staked on accuracy
- "I'd rather be fishing" than publish substandard work
- Craftsman mentality: stack dimes in welding = precision in writing

### Voice Development
Owner's voice defined as:
- Sean Connery richness + John Paul DeJoria class
- Long hair, commanding presence
- Technologist (30 years software/infrastructure)
- Gen X perspective, mentorship focus
- "Drag racing is for wennies" philosophy

### Platform Evolution Discussion
Recognition that file-based system will scale poorly:
- Graph database for knowledge cross-referencing needed
- Model classifier/router for local-first AI
- "Can't get model? Get it. Can't get it? Train it."
- GraphRAG for semantic conversation search
- Kaizen methodology: right until it's wrong, then evolve

### Critical Reality Check
**Owner (turning point moment):** "So far it would seem we have a massive amount of specs defined, conversation abound, but nothing is on disk. One trip over the powercord and the whole thing goes up in tire smoke. Just how quality is that?"

**Response:** Immediate action to persist all work:
- Created full directory structure
- Saved all specifications to disk
- Initiated conversation logging system

## Session Reflection

This session established the foundation for a comprehensive content creation and knowledge management platform. The shift from "let's create Q50 content" to "let's build the operating system for builder content creation" represents the right approach for long-term value.

Key success factors:
- Owner's clarity on quality standards (95%+ confidence, zero tolerance for inaccuracy)
- Recognition that this scales beyond one build
- Willingness to invest in proper infrastructure (graph DB, local AI, persistent knowledge)
- Craftsman mentality applied to content as to fabrication
- Reality check on persisting work to disk (critical learning moment)

The Q50 Super Saloon build will serve as v1.0 proof of concept. Success here validates the platform for future builds and potential consulting opportunities with other builders.

**Philosophy established: "Craftsmanship in communication, just as in fabrication."**
