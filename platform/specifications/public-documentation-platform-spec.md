# Public Documentation Platform Specification

**The Builder Platform - Documentation as Competitive Advantage**

**Last Updated:** October 7, 2024
**Status:** Strategic Priority - Pre-ProductHunt Launch Requirement
**Purpose:** Transparency builds trust. Documentation sells the platform.

---

## Executive Summary

**"Show your work. Earn their trust."**

Most startups hide their architecture as "competitive advantage." For The Builder Platform, **transparency IS the competitive advantage.**

**Core Insight:**
> "This documentation is what will sell the platform. This is that comfy blanket everyone wants before they roll the dice and drop a wad on your product."

**Target Audiences:**
1. **Investors:** Due diligence (security, architecture, compliance)
2. **Early Adopters:** Technical credibility (passkeys, 2-way doors, GDPR)
3. **Enterprise Customers:** Compliance proof (SOC 2 roadmap, NIST 800-53)
4. **Security Researchers:** Bug bounty participants, trust verification
5. **Future Employees:** Engineering culture, standards, decision-making

**Strategic Value:**
- Documentation demonstrates thought leadership
- Specs show depth of planning (not MVP scramble)
- Comment system = free product feedback
- AI interaction = dogfooding our own AI integration principles
- Public roadmap = builds anticipation

---

## Core Philosophy

### Documentation as Marketing

**Not:** Internal wiki hidden behind login
**But:** Public knowledge base that builds credibility

**Why this works:**
- **Transparency signals confidence:** "We're not hiding anything"
- **Depth signals competence:** "They thought through GDPR before building"
- **Process signals reliability:** "They won't back the cat into a corner"

### Foundation Over Speed

**User's Quote:**
> "I'm in no hurry to build this platform. Deep foundational structure and protection is what I'm after. I don't build houses of cards."

**What this means:**
- Document before building (specs drive implementation)
- Standards before features (2-way doors, security frameworks)
- Architecture before UI (passkeys from day 1, not bolted on)

**The Documentation Platform embodies this:**
- Not rushing to ProductHunt without proper foundation
- Specs are detailed, reviewed, version-controlled
- Community can see and comment on the thinking
- Platform improves through transparent feedback

---

## Requirements

### Must-Have (Pre-Launch)

**1. Static Site Generation**
- Markdown-based (specs already written in Markdown)
- Version control integration (auto-deploy from Git commits)
- Fast loading (<2s initial page load)
- Mobile-responsive (investors read on phones)
- SEO-optimized (Google indexes our specs)

**2. Navigation & Structure**
```

```

**3. Comment System (Per Section)**
- Threaded comments (reply to specific sections)
- GitHub authentication (verify identity, reduce spam)
- Markdown support (code blocks, formatting)
- Anchor links (comment on specific paragraphs)
- Email notifications (admin alerts on new comments)

**4. AI Comment Responder (Phase 1: Acknowledgment)**
```
User Comment:
"Have you considered WebAuthn conditional UI for resident keys?"

AI Response (within 5 minutes):
"Thank you for the suggestion! Conditional UI would improve the passkey UX by
showing available credentials automatically. I've flagged this for @admin review.

Relevant context: Our passkey spec (passkey-authentication-spec.md, lines 234-267)
discusses resident keys, but doesn't mention conditional UI yet.

Would you be willing to share implementation examples or resources?"

Status: 🏷️ Tagged for admin review
```

**5. Admin Dashboard**
- View all comments (unread, flagged for review, resolved)
- AI-extracted suggestions (structured summaries)
- Approve/reject/incorporate workflow
- Comment moderation (spam, abuse)
- Analytics (which docs get commented on, which suggestions adopted)

### Nice-to-Have (Post-Launch)

**6. Version History (Doc Evolution)**
- See how specs evolved over time
- Diff view (what changed between versions)
- "Why this changed" annotations (link to Git commit messages)

**7. Interactive Examples**
- Code sandboxes (try passkey registration in-browser)
- API playground (test endpoints with sample data)
- Architecture diagrams (interactive SVGs)

**8. Community Contributions**
- Pull requests to docs (suggest edits via GitHub)
- Contributor recognition (credits in docs)
- Bounty system (pay for valuable feedback)

**9. AI Phase 2: Draft Responses to Complex Questions**
```
User Comment:
"Your NIST 800-53 mapping is missing AU-12 (Audit Generation). How are you
addressing this control?"

AI Response (draft, awaiting admin approval):
"Great catch! AU-12 (Audit Generation) is indeed critical. Here's how we address it:

Current Implementation:
- AuditLog model in Prisma schema (security-and-governance-framework.md, line 487)
- All auth events logged (passkey-authentication-spec.md, line 892)
- API route logging middleware (to be documented in tech-architecture-spec.md)

Gap Identified:
- AU-12 requires specific audit events per NIST 800-53 Rev 5
- Need to document comprehensive audit event taxonomy

Proposed Action:
1. Create audit-event-taxonomy.md specification
2. Map to NIST AU-12 requirements explicitly
3. Update security-and-governance-framework.md with AU-12 compliance checklist

Would you be interested in reviewing the draft taxonomy?

Status: 🚧 Admin review pending - Flagged as high-priority compliance gap"
```

## Technical Architecture

### 2-Way Door Design

**Static Site Generator Options:**

**Option A: Nextra (Next.js + MDX)**
- Pros: Built on Next.js (same stack as main platform), MDX (components in docs), TypeScript support
- Cons: Less established than Docusaurus
- Escape hatch: Can migrate to Docusaurus (both use Markdown)

**Option B: Docusaurus (Facebook)**
- Pros: Battle-tested, great search, versioning built-in
- Cons: React-based but not Next.js (separate stack)
- Escape hatch: Can migrate to custom Next.js site

**Option C: VitePress (Vue-based)**
- Pros: Fast, modern, great DX
- Cons: Vue (different from our React stack)
- Escape hatch: Can migrate to Nextra/Docusaurus

**Recommendation: Nextra**
- Same tech stack as main platform (Next.js, React, TypeScript)
- MDX = can embed interactive components (passkey demo, code sandboxes)
- Easy to customize (own the code)
- Vercel deployment (same as main app)

**Abstraction Layer:**
```typescript
// lib/docs/content-provider.ts
interface DocsContentProvider {
  listPages(): Promise<Page[]>
  getPage(slug: string): Promise<Page>
  searchPages(query: string): Promise<Page[]>
  getComments(pageId: string): Promise<Comment[]>
  addComment(pageId: string, comment: CommentInput): Promise<Comment>
}

// Nextra adapter (current)
class NextraProvider implements DocsContentProvider { ... }

// Future: Can swap to Docusaurus, custom CMS, etc.
class DocusaurusAdapter implements DocsContentProvider { ... }
```

---

### Comment System Architecture

**Option A: Giscus (GitHub Discussions)**
- Pros: Free, GitHub auth, threaded, Markdown support
- Cons: Tied to GitHub (can't easily move), limited AI integration
- Escape hatch: Export comments to custom system later

**Option B: Custom Comment System (PostgreSQL + API)**
- Pros: Full control, AI integration native, can add features freely
- Cons: More initial work (~1 week), need moderation tools
- Escape hatch: Can use Giscus initially, migrate later

**Hybrid Approach (2-Way Door):**

**Phase 1 (Pre-Launch): Giscus**
- Fast setup (<1 day)
- GitHub auth = identity verification
- Threaded comments = organized discussion
- AI reads comments via GitHub API

**Phase 2 (Post-Launch): Custom System**
- Migrate comments from GitHub Discussions to PostgreSQL
- Add AI responder (direct integration, no API lag)
- Admin dashboard (approval workflow, analytics)
- Enhanced features (voting, resolution tracking)

**Migration Path:**
```typescript
// Export from GitHub Discussions
const discussions = await octokit.graphql(`
  query {
    repository(owner: "builder-platform", name: "docs") {
      discussions(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          title
          body
          comments(first: 100) {
            nodes {
              author { login }
              body
              createdAt
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`)

// Import to PostgreSQL
for (const discussion of discussions.repository.discussions.nodes) {
  await prisma.docComment.create({
    data: {
      pageSlug: discussion.title,
      body: discussion.body,
      authorGithub: discussion.author.login,
      createdAt: discussion.createdAt,
      replies: {
        create: discussion.comments.nodes.map(c => ({
          body: c.body,
          authorGithub: c.author.login,
          createdAt: c.createdAt,
        })),
      },
    },
  })
}
```

---

### AI Comment Responder Architecture

**Goal:** AI acknowledges comments, extracts suggestions, flags for admin review.

**NOT:** AI makes decisions, modifies docs without approval.

**Phase 1: Acknowledgment Bot**

```typescript
// AI responds to new comments (within 5 minutes)
async function handleNewComment(comment: Comment) {
  // 1. Analyze comment sentiment & intent
  const analysis = await analyzeComment(comment.body)

  if (analysis.type === 'SPAM') {
    // Flag for moderation, don't respond
    await flagComment(comment.id, 'SPAM')
    return
  }

  // 2. Extract relevant context from docs
  const relevantSections = await findRelevantDocs(comment.body)

  // 3. Generate acknowledgment response
  const response = await generateAcknowledgment({
    comment: comment.body,
    context: relevantSections,
    type: analysis.type, // QUESTION, SUGGESTION, ISSUE, PRAISE
  })

  // 4. Post AI response
  await postComment(comment.threadId, response)

  // 5. Notify admin if actionable
  if (analysis.type === 'SUGGESTION' || analysis.type === 'ISSUE') {
    await notifyAdmin({
      commentId: comment.id,
      type: analysis.type,
      summary: analysis.summary,
      suggestedAction: analysis.action,
    })
  }
}
```

**AI Response Templates:**

**Type: QUESTION**
```
Thank you for the question!

[RELEVANT_CONTEXT from docs]

Does this address your question? If not, I'll flag this for @admin
to provide more detailed clarification.
```

**Type: SUGGESTION**
```

## Content Strategy

### What Gets Documented (Public)

**✅ Publish:**
- All standards (architectural decisions, security frameworks)
- All specifications (passkeys, UI/UX, features)
- Compliance documentation (GDPR, SOC 2, NIST)
- Technical architecture (high-level, not implementation secrets)
- API documentation (once API is public)
- Roadmap (transparent about what's coming)
- Changelog (what changed and why)

**❌ Don't Publish:**
- Encryption keys, API secrets (obviously)
- Customer data, case studies (without permission)
- Unvalidated ideas (wait until spec is reviewed)
- Internal financials, cap table (not relevant)
- Known unpatched vulnerabilities (responsible disclosure first)

### Documentation Standards

**Markdown Format:**
```markdown
# Specification Title

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Draft | Review | Approved | Deprecated
**Applies To:** Audience/scope

---

## Executive Summary
[1-2 paragraphs: What, why, who cares]

## Core Requirements
[Must-have features]

## Technical Architecture
[How it works, 2-way door design]

## Implementation Details
[Code examples, schemas, workflows]

## References
[External links, related specs]

## Tag Index

---

## Analytics & Feedback Loop

### Track

**Engagement:**
- Page views (which specs get read most)
- Time on page (which specs get studied deeply)
- Scroll depth (do people finish reading?)
- Outbound clicks (which external resources are useful?)

**Comments:**
- Comment volume per spec
- AI response rate (% of comments AI handles without admin)
- Admin incorporation rate (% of suggestions adopted)
- Time to respond (admin response latency)

**SEO:**
- Organic search traffic (Google Search Console)
- Top search queries (what brings people here)
- Backlinks (who links to our docs)
- Domain authority (Moz, Ahrefs)

### Iterate

**Monthly Review:**
- Which specs need clarification? (high comments, low satisfaction)
- Which specs are most valuable? (high traffic, low bounce rate)
- Which AI responses need improvement? (admin overrides frequently)
- Which suggestions are most common? (themes in feedback)

**Quarterly Goals:**
- Increase organic traffic (target: 10k monthly visitors by Q2 2025)
- Improve AI response quality (target: 80% admin approval rate)
- Build backlink profile (target: 50 quality backlinks by Q4 2025)
- Community contributions (target: 10 accepted PRs per quarter)

---

## Security & Moderation

### Comment Moderation

**Auto-Flag for Review:**
- Spam keywords (viagra, crypto, etc.)
- External links (verify not phishing)
- Profanity or abuse
- Repetitive comments (same user, same text)

**GitHub Auth Requirements:**
- Must have GitHub account (identity verification)
- Account >30 days old (reduce spam)
- Email verified (GitHub requirement)

**Admin Tools:**
- Ban user (by GitHub username)
- Delete comment (with reason logged)
- Edit comment (fix typos, remove sensitive info)
- Lock thread (prevent further comments)

---

### Rate Limiting

**Comment Posting:**
- 5 comments per hour per user (prevent spam)
- 1 comment per minute per user (prevent flooding)
- 100 comments per day site-wide (detect attacks)

**AI Responses:**
- 1 response per comment (don't spam thread)
- 5-minute delay (give humans time to respond first)
- Max 10 AI responses per hour (prevent runaway bot)

---

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Hosting

**Static Site:** Vercel (same as main platform)
- Custom domain: `docs.builder-platform.com`
- Automatic deployments (Git push → live in 30s)
- Edge network (fast globally)
- HTTPS by default (Let's Encrypt)

**Database (Comments):** PostgreSQL (shared with main platform)
- Same Prisma instance
- Same audit logging
- Same backup strategy

**AI Service:** OpenAI API or self-hosted LLM
- Comment analysis + response generation
- Rate limiting (cost control)
- Fallback to manual (if AI unavailable)

---

### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml

## Competitive Advantage Analysis

### What Competitors Do

**Notion, Airtable, Coda:**
- Public changelog (feature announcements)
- API docs (technical reference)
- Help center (user guides)
- ❌ NO deep architecture docs
- ❌ NO compliance frameworks
- ❌ NO decision-making transparency

**Stripe, Cloudflare (Developer-Focused):**
- ✅ Excellent API docs
- ✅ Integration guides
- ✅ Some architecture blog posts
- ❌ Still no comprehensive specs
- ❌ No interactive community feedback

**Open Source Projects (Linux, Kubernetes):**
- ✅ Transparent development (GitHub, mailing lists)
- ✅ RFC process (community proposals)
- ✅ Comprehensive docs
- ❌ Often overwhelming (not structured for non-developers)
- ❌ No "why we made these decisions" narrative

### What We Do Differently

**✅ Comprehensive Specs (Not Just API Docs)**
- Architectural decisions (2-way doors)
- Security frameworks (GDPR, SOC 2, NIST)
- Implementation details (passkey flows, database schemas)

**✅ Transparent Decision-Making**
- Show our work (why we chose passkeys over passwords)
- Document trade-offs (Clerk vs NextAuth analysis)
- Explain principles (foundation over speed)

**✅ Interactive Community Feedback**
- AI responds to comments (not passive docs)
- Admin reviews and incorporates suggestions
- Community shapes the platform (credited contributors)

**✅ Trust-Building Before Sales**
- Investors see depth before writing checks
- Early adopters verify security before signing up
- Enterprises get compliance proof before procurement

**The Result:**
> "This documentation is what will sell the platform."

## Meta: This Spec Itself

**Irony Alert:** This specification will be published on the documentation platform it describes.

**Self-Referential Example:**
```
User Comment on "Public Documentation Platform Spec":
"This is brilliant. You're documenting how you'll document. Meta-documentation."

AI Response:
"Thank you! Yes, this spec will be published on the very platform it describes.

If you have suggestions for the docs platform itself, this is the place to
share them. We're eating our own dog food from day one.

Relevant principle: 2-way-door-decision-principles.md - We can start simple
(Nextra + Giscus) and enhance later (custom comment system with AI).

Status: 🏷️ Meta-feedback welcome"
