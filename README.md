# The Builder Platform

**Agent OS for Automotive Content Creation & Builder Knowledge Management**

## Overview

This is a comprehensive platform for creating high-quality automotive content while building a persistent knowledge base. The Q50 Super Saloon project is v1.0 - future builds will leverage the same infrastructure, agents, and standards.

## Core Philosophy

**Quality over flash. Substance over hype. Truth over everything.**

- Zero tolerance for inaccuracy (95%+ confidence on all specs)
- Cost-conscious quality (throw money at what matters)
- Gentleman's weapon philosophy (understated elegance meets serious capability)
- Kaizen methodology (continuous improvement in all things)
- Craftsmanship in communication, just as in fabrication

## Current Project: Q50 Super Saloon

**Vision:** 600-800hp gentleman's weapon. Friday night gala, Saturday morning track terror.

**Build Philosophy:**
- 80/20 street/track split
- Understated elegance with undeniable capability
- Cost-conscious quality (KW coilovers, pull-a-part control arms)
- Everything verified, documented, shared

**Content Goals:**
- Long-form articles (3,500-5,000 words)
- Video content (15-20 min long-form, 60-90 sec shorts)
- Speaking presentations (18-20 min TED-style)
- Weekly publication cadence starting Nov 1, 2024

## Platform Features

### Specialized Agents
- **Technical Research Agent:** Deep-dive technical investigation
- **Historical Research Agent:** Heritage, lineage, competitive context
- **Content Writer Agent:** Publication-ready articles
- **Video Producer Agent:** Scripts, shot lists, production planning
- **Speaking Coach Agent:** Presentation structure and delivery
- **Fact-Checker Agent:** Verification of all claims
- **Editor Agent:** Final polish and voice consistency

### Quality Standards
- **Source Verification Protocol:** Tier 1/2/3 source hierarchy
- **95%+ Confidence Requirement:** On all specs driving build decisions
- **Writing Style Guide:** Voice consistency across all platforms
- **Review Workflow:** Multi-gate quality control

### Future Architecture
- **Graph Database:** Knowledge cross-referencing (Neo4j planned)
- **Model Classifier & Router:** Local-first AI with cloud fallback
- **Graph RAG:** Semantic search across conversation history
- **Conversation Logging:** 2hr/80% context triggers with tagging

## Getting Started

1. **Current Focus:** Complete Q50 research specifications
2. **Next Phase:** Launch parallel research agents for data gathering
3. **Then:** Content creation based on validated research
4. **Finally:** Multi-platform publishing (Medium, YouTube, speaking)

## Standards Documents

## Version History

- **v1.0** - October 2024: Platform initialization, Q50 project start
- **Future:** C63 AMG build, consulting for other builders

## Contact & Collaboration

This platform is designed to:
- Document builds with professional-grade content
- Share knowledge with the builder community
- Establish expertise through verified, quality work
- Enable consulting and mentorship opportunities

**Reputation is built on what you deliver, not what you promise.**
