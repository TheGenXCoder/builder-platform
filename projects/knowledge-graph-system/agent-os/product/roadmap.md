# Product Roadmap

> This roadmap accounts for part-time building initially (evenings/weekends while maintaining job), accelerating as traction/validation/funding arrives. Timeline estimates assume 15-20 hours/week initially, scaling to full-time as milestones unlock funding or allow job transition.

---

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Proof of Concept
**Timeline:** Months 1-2 (Part-Time: 8-10 weeks) | **Effort:** M-L per feature

### Goals
- Build functional core infrastructure that proves the concept
- Demonstrate AI-agnostic knowledge graph working with multiple models
- Create compelling demos for developer community validation
- Establish technical foundation for all future development

### Features

1. [ ] **PostgreSQL + pgvector Foundation** — Set up PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension for vector embeddings, full-text search, and relational data. Design schema for entities, relationships, embeddings, and metadata. Implement migration system. `M`

2. [ ] **Entity Extraction Pipeline (Python)** — Build Python ML service using spaCy/Ollama for extracting entities (people, concepts, code, decisions) from text. Process AI conversation transcripts into structured entities. Store entities with embeddings in PostgreSQL. `L`

3. [ ] **Embedding Generation Service** — Integrate Ollama with nomic-embed-text model for generating semantic embeddings. Create embeddings for entities, relationships, and queries. Implement batch processing for large document ingestion. `M`

4. [ ] **Go CLI - Basic Commands** — Build foundational CLI in Go: `kg init` (initialize knowledge graph), `kg ingest` (add text/conversation), `kg query` (natural language search), `kg status` (graph statistics). Single-binary distribution with no dependencies. `L`

5. [ ] **Natural Language Query Engine** — Convert natural language queries to vector similarity search + full-text search combination. Rank results by relevance. Return entities and their relationships in human-readable format. Target: sub-second response on 10K entity graphs. `L`

6. [ ] **Multi-Model AI Connector** — Build abstraction layer for connecting to different AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama). Unified interface for sending context and receiving responses. Implement at least 3 model integrations: GPT-4, Claude, and local Ollama model. `M`

7. [ ] **Context Injection System** — Automatically inject relevant context from knowledge graph into AI conversations. Query graph for related entities before each AI interaction. Format context for optimal AI consumption (structured summaries, not raw dumps). `M`

8. [ ] **Demo Application & Documentation** — Create compelling demo showing: (1) conversation with GPT-4, (2) knowledge extracted to graph, (3) switch to Claude mid-conversation with context preserved, (4) query knowledge graph weeks later with new model. Document setup, usage, and architecture for early adopters. `M`

### Success Criteria
- Core infrastructure functional: ingest → extract → embed → query → inject workflow complete
- 3+ AI models integrated and switchable mid-conversation
- Demo proves concept: same knowledge graph works with different AI models
- Documentation sufficient for technical early adopters to self-serve
- Personal use for 2+ weeks validates basic utility

### Build-in-Public Activities
- Weekly dev log blog posts documenting design decisions
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) published as decisions are made
- GitHub repository public from day one (issues, PRs, commits visible)
- Twitter/X thread series: "Building AI-agnostic infrastructure in public"

## Execution Principles Throughout

### Sustainable Pace (Non-Negotiable)

- **No burnout culture:** sustainable hours, family time protected, faith practices maintained
- **Part-time initially:** evenings/weekends until validation/funding/revenue justifies full-time
- **Hiring to scale:** don't hero as solo developer; build team as resources allow
- **Long-term play:** 5-10 year vision requires marathon pace, not sprint

### Build-in-Public (Every Phase)

- **Transparent progress:** blog posts, metrics shared, challenges documented
- **Teaching throughout:** conference talks, articles, mentorship—not deferred until "after exit"
- **Community-driven:** early adopters co-create product, not just consume it
- **Authenticity:** no hype, no fake-it-till-you-make-it, real progress honestly shared

### Infrastructure Mindset (Strategic North Star)

- **Not a feature race:** we're not competing with ChatGPT memory; we're building the layer beneath
- **Open source core:** community trust and ecosystem growth require open infrastructure
- **Standards-based:** interoperability and portability are competitive advantages, not afterthoughts
- **Patience for network effects:** infrastructure takes time; compounding value happens slowly then suddenly

### Faith & Family Boundaries (Foundation)

- **Non-negotiable:** faith practices and family time are not sacrificed for milestones
- **Sustainable success:** building something that honors values, not just market
- **Impact over vanity metrics:** success is defined by legacy and transformation, not just valuation
- **Second-act founder wisdom:** this is about doing it right, not just doing it fast

---

## Notes

- **Effort Scale:** XS (1 day), S (2-3 days), M (1 week), L (2 weeks), XL (3+ weeks)
- **Timeline Assumptions:** Part-time (Months 1-6) = 15-20 hrs/week; Full-time (Month 7+) = 40 hrs/week
- **Funding Milestones:** Phase 2 end (angel/pre-seed), Phase 3 end (seed), Year 2 (Series A if scaling aggressively)
- **Dependencies:** Each phase builds on previous; no skipping allowed (infrastructure requires foundation)
- **Flexibility:** Roadmap is strategic plan, not contract; adapt based on user feedback and market validation

---

**This is a marathon. You're built for it. Let's run it sustainably, impactfully, and on your terms.**
